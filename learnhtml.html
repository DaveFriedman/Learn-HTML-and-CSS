        <h1>internetingishard is easy!</h1>
        <p>Hello, world! <br> 
        It's meeeee</p>

        <h2>Heading 2</h2>
        <h3>There are (h3)</h3>
        <h4>six (h4)</h4>
        <h5>levels (h5)</h5>
        <h6>of headings (h6)</h6>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        Unordered lists:
        <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" (Unordered List) element.</li>
            <li>Give each item it's own "li" element</li>
            <li>Don't worry about the order, obviously</li>
        </ul>
        Ordered lists:
        <ol>
            <li>First things first</li>
            <li>Second</li>
            <li value=6>can also skip, using value=#</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
        This is some <strong>bolded</strong> text, now some <em>italicized</em> text.
        But we use the (strong) and (em), for "emphasized" tags now, instead of (b) and (i),
        because there should be a clear separation between a document's structure and its presentation,
        emphasized text could be displayed many different ways, not just with italics. Same with strong text.

        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
        <p>This is some text in a paragraph block, with a newline (br) <br>
            Then, a horizontal line, using the (hr) tag, which MDN says is a "thematic break".
            In the past, (hr) stood for "horizontal rule"</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Written by, <br>
            Me.</p>
