        <h1>Images</h1>
        <p>This page covers common image formats, 
            but also check out <a href="links.html">links</a> and
            <a href="misc/extras.html">some extras</a>.</p>

        <h2>JPGs:</h2>
        <p> JPG images are good for photos. <br>
            They handle large color palattes well, but can't have transparent pixels.</p>
        <img src="images/mochi.jpg" width="75" alt="A mochi ball in a bubble"/>

        <h2>GIFs:</h2>
        <p> GIFs are good for animations! <br>
            They can handle transparency, but not partial opacity. 
            They have less dynamic colors than JPGs.</p>
        <img src="images/mochi.gif" width="75" alt="A dancing mochi ball"/>

        <h3>PNGs:</h3>
        <p> PNGS are good for diagrams and icons. <br>
            They handle multiple levels of opacity, and can have as many colors as a JPG,
            but typically have larger file sizes.</p>
        <img src="images/mochi.png" width="75" alt="A happy mochi ball"/>

        <h3>SVGs:</h3>
        <p> SVGs are vector-based graphics, so they can scale to any size. <br>
            This makes them very good for responsive websites.</p>
